### Objective: 
* Given a sampled graph signal (i.e.: a low granularity sensor network), interpolate the graph signal to obtain the entire network and make temporal prediction simultaneously.
### Dataset
* Check out this [link](https://github.com/zhiyongc/Seattle-Loop-Data)   for downloading the Seattle loop dataset
### Environment
* Python 3.6.1 and PyTorch 1.4.0
* Installation: 
```
python setup.py install
```
